# This is a 'pcal' input file to test character mappings (PostScript 'vector
# encodings') for a single character set:
# 
#    pcal -f fonttest_hebrew
# 
# The characters are printed in ascending numeric order.
# 
opt -S   # suppress small prev/next monthly calendars
opt -B   # leave unused boxes blank
opt -b all   # use black for all days' numerics
opt -r Hebrew   # force the proper character set encoding
opt -C "ISO 8859-8 (Hebrew) character mappings"   # centered 'footer' string

# 
# This encoding is not currently supported by 'pcal'!
