Dec 25*				Christmas Day
# Where any of above fall on a weekend, most institutions will observe a
# holiday on the nearest weekday (Fri, or Mon.).  The following will mark
# those days as holidays.  This doesn't seem to work as I expect for New
# Year's.  It seems to be a problem with spanning a year boundary, since
# the holiday to be marked may fall in the previous year (for an example
# see: Dec.  31, 2004.)
weekday nearest Jan 1*		# nonworkday in observance of New Year's Day
weekday nearest Jul 4*		# nonworkday in observance of Independence Day
weekday nearest Nov 11*		# nonworkday in observance of Veterans Day
weekday nearest Dec 25*		# nonworkday in observance of Christmas Day
# Martin Luther King, Jr.'s actual birthdate is January 15, 1929, but US
# Code specifies the holiday fall on the third Monday in January.  January
# 15 and the third Monday will only coincide if January 1 is a Monday.
third Mon in Jan*		Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. (observed)
# George Washington's actual birthdate is February 22, 1732, (February 11,
# 1732 in the Julian calendar system that was in use at the time) but US
# Code specifies that the holiday fall on the third Monday in February.
# February 22 can never be the third Monday.  This holiday is often referred
# to as "Presidents' Day" to also honor Abraham Lincoln.
third Mon in Feb*		Washington's Birthday (observed)
last Mon in May*		Memorial Day
first Mon in Sep*		Labor Day
second Mon in Oct*		Columbus Day
