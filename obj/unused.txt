This file exists only to ensure that this otherwise-empty directory is
properly created when you extract the files in the 'tar' file.  You may safely
remove it once the 'tar' files have been extracted.

This problem seems to exist only with extraction utilities (e.g. WinZip) that
fail to create a subdirectory when there are no files in it.
